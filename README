Booty
========

Creates an unguessable/hidden url to keep out the bots and spiders.


Example
=======

script/generate booty music

this creates a booty/music/kDF..83s/ directory to put your stuff in.
you are also given a nice view that breaks down whatever you dump in there-- it is reachable from /kDF..83s/
the view is haml only at the moment (but you can always edit to erb if you need to)

create as many silos as you want.  you can also use a different controller name if you prefer.


super easy.  super sweet.


Git Users
=========
assuming you don't want to track whatever you dump in the booty directories, you will have to add those directories to your .gitignore, but still touch a file that won't be ignored in the directory so that the dir structure is maintained in production


Other info
==========
:pretend option works
script/destroy also works
