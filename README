Booty
========

Creates an unguessable/hidden url to keep out the bots and spiders.


Example
=======

script/generate booty music

this creates a booty/music/kDF..83s/ directory to put your stuff in.
you are also given a nice view that breaks down whatever you dump in there-- it is reachable from /kDF..83s/
the view is haml only at the moment (but you can always edit to erb if you need to)


super easy.  super sweet.
